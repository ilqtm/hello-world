# hello-world

Learning git and github by doing. Daily commits is the path. Learning is the goal.

I've got a lot on deck and am excited about all of it:

- Node.js
- Python
- AWS Architecting and DevOps
- etc, too much to list! More as I go on


So long for now.

The goal is similar, but there's a little more to show for it.

 - upcoming actual project pages and commits
 - ansible
 - bootcamp projects from online resources
 - let's encrypt implementation
 - CloudFront and Lambda implementation
